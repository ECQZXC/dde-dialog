# Dde Dialog

Dde dialog is a unified pop-up interface provided by dde. Currently, the system cannot call the dtk library to notify users of pop-up notifications (such as external devices being controlled, application permissions being restricted, etc.). 

dde needs to provide an interface similar to system notifications, which can be customized by the system to pass the title, content, and buttons of the pop-up to the interface. The pop-up can be triggered in the graphical interface to prompt the user.
